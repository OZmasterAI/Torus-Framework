# Examples Directory

Curated code patterns for AI reference during implementation.
Add patterns here that should be consistently followed across the project.

## Structure
- One file or directory per pattern
- Name descriptively: `api-endpoint-pattern.py`, `test-structure/`
- Include comments explaining WHY the pattern exists

## Usage
PRPs reference patterns from this directory in the "Examples" section.
When implementing a PRP, check here first before inventing new approaches.
